# Write an angry boss program that rudely asks what you want. Whatever you
# answer, the angry boss must yell it back to you and then fire you.
#
# Here's how the program must work:
#
#   $ ruby exercise6.rb
#   CAN'T YOU SEE I'M BUSY?! MAKE IT FAST, JOHNSON!
#   i want a raise
#   WHADDAYA MEAN 'I WANT A RAISE'?!? YOU'RE FIRED!!

puts "CAN'T YOU SEE I'M BUSY?! MAKE IT FAST, JOHNSON!"
requeset = gets.chomp

puts "WHADDAYA MEAN '#{request.upcase}'?!? YOU'RE FIRED!!"


puts 'CAN\'T YOU SEE I\'M BUSY?! MAKE IT FAST, JOHNSON!'
var1 = gets.chomp

puts 'WHADDAYA MEAN \'' + var1.upcase + '\'?!? YOU\'RE FIRED!!'
